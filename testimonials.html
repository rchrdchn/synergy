                    <p class="testimonials__text">"Since our team members are spread out in different locations around the Bay Area, it was important to us to find a company that met our needs: flexibility, knowledge of craft, professionalism, personality and affordability. That company was Synergy Massage."</p>

                    <p class="testimonials__text">"I had the pleasure of receiving a wonderful massage from Linda at work through our Wellness Program. With only 15 minutes, Linda was able to get most of my knots out of my back and had me feeling relaxed and ready for the weekend!”</p>

                    <p class="testimonials__text">"After a hard day bent over a keyboard, eyes squinting at the screen editing, animating and/or designing, Linda's hands are like magic. She is in our office promptly, efficient and the 30 minute escape where she works our tired shoulders, back and arms is the highlight of the week. Very professional, skilled, and friendly. I would highly recommend her as a corporate on-site massage therapist for any organization."</p>

I have neck, shoulder and back issues and every time I see Linda whether it's a 15 or 45 minute chair massage in the middle of the work, I leave feeling refreshed, relaxed and pain free. I highly recommend her to anyone looking to bring in a corporate massage therapist. She would be a wonderful 'perk' for any employee.”</p>
